FaceWindow "BOWIE, we've almost arrived at Sero's Woods. Do you remember our orders?^We need to defeat all of the enemy forces at each of the blockades they have set up along the road.^*4CHESTER is a centaur knight. He can move very far each round and can equip lances and spears.^*4Lances hit harder than spears, but spears can be thrown and have a greater range.^*4Choose which weapon to have Chester take into battle by pressing X, then select Item, then Equip." 5

FaceWindow "Remember, BOWIE, if you fall in battle, our side is defeated!^Also, take extra care as we have no healers on the force, and have been given no first aid supplies.^I have to admit, this battle could be tricky. I'm a little worried...^*4LUKE is a birdman fighter. He can fly over rough and even impassible terrain, reaching places other members cannot.^*4However, his low defense makes him fragile, so be careful not to overcommit and let him get too far from the group!" 7
